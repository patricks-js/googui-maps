## üöÄ Getting Started

This project is a simple maps application, that gives a simple solution to find the best path between two points on a map. Inspired by Google Maps, but with a focus on the routing functionality.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js
- Docker

### Installation

1. Clone the repository

    ```bash
    git clone https://gitlab.com/jala-university1/cohort-1/oficial-pt-programa-o-4-apr-221/se-o-b/pes-de-pano
    ```

2. Install dependencies

    ```bash
    pnpm install
    ```

3. Up containers

    ```bash
    pnpm services:up
    ```

4. Start the application

    ```bash
    pnpm start
    ```

5. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3333/docs`

### Running the tests

- Run tests

    ```bash
    pnpm test
    ```

- Run tests on watch mode

    ```bash
    pnpm test:watch
    ```

- Run tests on coverage mode

    ```bash
    pnpm test:coverage
    ```

- Run tests on UI mode

    ```bash
    pnpm test:ui
    ```
